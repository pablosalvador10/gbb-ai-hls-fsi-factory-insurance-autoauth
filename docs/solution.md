# 🤖 The AutoAuth Solution

**AutoAuth** revolutionizes the Prior Authorization (PA) process by integrating cutting-edge AI, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), and intelligent retrieval systems. This approach minimizes manual workload, accelerates decision-making, and enhances accuracy, all while complying with emerging regulations like CMS 2026 standards.

## Core Methodology

1. **Data Extraction & Structuring**
   - Use LLM-powered Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Azure Document Intelligence to convert unstructured data (e.g., PDFs, clinical notes) into structured JSON.
   - Extract clinical entities like ICD-10 codes, lab results, and physician notes for precise policy matching.

2. **Policy Matching & Hybrid Retrieval**
   - Employ a hybrid approach combining vector-based semantic search and BM25 lexical search via Azure Cognitive Search.
   - Dynamically rank and retrieve policy documents that align with case-specific clinical data.

3. **Reasoning & Decision Support**
   - Use Azure OpenAI models to assess policies and recommend decisions (Approve, Deny, or Request Additional Information).
   - Leverage Semantic Kernel to orchestrate retrieval, reasoning, and decision-making workflows.

## Enhanced Capabilities

- **LLMOps with AI Studio**
   - Continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement of model performance ensure reliability and scalability.
   - Fine-tuned prompts reduce hallucinations and align outcomes with regulatory and clinical guidelines.

- **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Incorporates agentic pipelines for robust policy matching and reasoning processes.
   - Flag missing data or partially met criteria, ensuring decisions are grounded in complete information.

- **Transparency & Compliance**
   - Outputs detailed rationale for each decision, improving auditability and fostering trust between payors and providers.

- **Scalable & Configurable Architecture**
   - Deploy quickly with Azure Bicep templates.
   - Modular design ensures easy integration with existing systems and future-ready capabilities.
